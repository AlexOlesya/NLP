# The course on text processing (NLP)
Task 1 (go to Muginova_Olesya_NLP1 file):
There are following tasks that have been done:

1. Data preprocessing using regular expressions leaving abstracts only
2. Data preprocessing using lematization, tf-idf model
3. Topic modeling using LSI and LDA models
4. Oprimization of topics' number (Coherence metrics)
5. Topics' visualization
6. Comparison of the results

Task 2 (go to Muginova_Olesya_NLP2 file):
There are following tasks that have been done:

1. Download no less that 300 pages from zpp.rospotrebnadzor.ru
2. Text preprocessing
3. Topic modeling using LSI model
4. Random Forest

Task 3 (go to Muginova_Olesya_NLP3 file): There are following tasks that have been done:

1. We use data from the Task 2
2. Vectorization with tf-idf
3. Vectorization with word2vec
4. Random Forest
5. Compare the quality and answer the question "How do different vectorisation methods influence on model's quality?"

FINAL PROJECT (has been created in the group of 2 people) (go to Chatbot -- Weather by Polesya file):

1. Create the chatbot which tells users the weather in two cities (Saint Petersburg, Moscow)
2. The chatbot can:
* welcome a user, say goodbye 
* understand such dates as now, today, tomorrow
* respond to unclear commands
* be precise and ask for necessary info if the user doesn't tell it full information
The weather is imported using API OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/)
