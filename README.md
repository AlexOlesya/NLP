# The course on text processing (NLP)
Task 1 (go to Muginova_Olesya_NLP1 file):
There are following tasks that have been done:

Data preprocessing using regular expressions leaving abstracts only
Data preprocessing using lematization, tf-idf model
Topic modeling using LSI and LDA models
Oprimization of topics' number (Coherence metrics)
Topics' visualization
Comparison of the results
Task 2 (go to Muginova_Olesya_NLP2 file):
There are following tasks that have been done:

Download no less that 300 pages from zpp.rospotrebnadzor.ru
Text preprocessing
Topic modeling using LSI model
Random Forest
Task 3 (go to Muginova_Olesya_NLP3 file): There are following tasks that have been done:

We use data from the Task 2
Vectorization with tf-idf
Vectorization with word2vec
Random Forest
Compare the quality and answer the question "How do different vectorisation methods influence on model's quality?"
FINAL PROJECT (has been created in the group of 2 people) (go to Chatbot -- Weather by Polesya file):

Create the chatbot which tells users the weather in two cities (Saint Petersburg, Moscow)
The chatbot can
welcome a user, say goodbye
understand such dates as now, today, tomorrow
respond to unclear commands
be precise and ask for necessary info if the user doesn't tell it full information
The weather is imported using API OpenWeatherMap
